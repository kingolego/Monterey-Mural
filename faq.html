                The <em>Mural</em> was conceived in 1983,
                one of a series of art acquisitions for the Conference Center, led by

                  Peter Coniglio</a>, the mayor of Monterey during its original development.
                Maestro Granizo worked on the <em>Mural</em> through 1983 and 1984
                &mdash; see his dates and initials in the bottom row of tiles.
                During this time he also created the larger <cite>Olympic Fantasy</cite> in Los Angeles.
                <p>At the Mural's unveiling on March 27, 1984,
                  Granizo was glad his work was able to include 
                  &ldquo;every type of person: the carefree Indians, merchants,
                  photographers and honky-tonk vendors.&rdquo;
                  Granizo dedicated his mural to &ldquo;people I relate to, 
                  who don't wear shoes or comb their hair ...
                  to the physically disabled &lbrack;his left leg is paralyzed

                Ironically, Granizo did not feature any visual artists and there are many to choose from.
                Many consider Carmel to be the archetypal &ldquo;artist colony&rdquo;,
                but the physical beauty of the Central Coast started drawing artists
                to Monterey and the Peninsula long before the start of the 20th Century.

                  is an assembly of closely spaced poly- or monochrome pieces (tesserae)
                  of stone, shell, glass, metal, ceramic or other material
                  embedded in a binder such as mortar or cement.
                  Considered a historical convergence of art and architecture,
                  this medium has been used to decorate walls, floors and columns for over five thousand years.
                  The Catalan architect Antonin Gaudí (1852-1926)

                  is an artwork applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface,
                  typically by painting either the surface directly
                  or on canvas or other material, which is then attached to a wall or other surface;
                  the <em>marouflage</em> method has been used for millennia.
                  In the early 20th century,
                  the term became associated with the Mexican muralism art renaissance,
                  led by José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros.
