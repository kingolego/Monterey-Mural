                &ldquo;When was the <em>Monterey Mural</em> created?&rdquo;</a>
              </h4>
              <blockquote>
                The <em>Mural</em> was conceived in 1983,
                one of a series of art acquisitions for the Conference Center, led by 
                <a href="https://italianheritagemonterey.org/story/honorees-italian-heritage-society/coniglio-peter-honoree-2002.html">
                  Peter Coniglio</a>, the mayor of Monterey during the initial Center's development.
                Maestro Granizo worked on the <em>Mural</em> through 1983 and 1984
                &mdash; see his dates and initials in the bottom row of tiles.
                During this time he also created the larger <cite>Olympic Fantasy</cite> in Los Angeles.
                <p>At the Mural's unveiling on March 27, 1984,
                  Granizo was glad his work was able to include 
                  &ldquo;every type of person: the carefree Indians, merchants,
                  photographers and honky-tonk vendors.&rdquo;
                  Granizo dedicated his mural to &ldquo;people I relate to, 
                  who don't wear shoes or comb their hair ...
                  to the physically disabled &lbrack;his left leg is paralyzed
                  &mdash; an injury incurred on Utah Beach during the WWII D-Day assault&rbrack; ...
                  to the Spanish-speaking ... to your citizens ... (and) to people who enjoy life.&rdquo;

                Now one of the area's major attractions, the Aquarium opened in 1984 
                &mdash; the same year as the <em>Mural</em>.
