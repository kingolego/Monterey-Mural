        <p>By Charles C. Mann
        <p>Anyone who attempts to write or even speak about the original inhabitants of the Americas
          quickly runs into terminological quicksand.
          And the attempt to extracate writer and reader by being logical and sensitive
          often ends with both parties sucked deeper into the mire.
          The difficulties fall into two broad categories:
          names for individual groups of Indians,
          and names for social categories to classify those groups.
          Most well known among the former is &ldquo;Indian&rdquo;,
          a term so long recognized as absurd that in the 1960s and 1970s
          social scientists moved to change it to &ldquo;Native American&rdquo;
          or, sometimes, &ldquo;Amerindian&rdquo;
        <p>The change was well meaning, but not entirely successful.
          On a literal level, the replacement name is as problematic as the original.
          &ldquo;Native American&rdquo; is intended to refer to the peoples
          who inhabitated the Americas before Columbus arrived and their descendants today.
          Literally, though, it means something else:
          as the activist Russell Means has complained,
          &ldquo;Anyone born in the Western Hemisphere is a Native American.&rdquo; 
          Worse, the term introduces an entirely new set of confusions.
          &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; does not refer to the Inuit, Aleut and peoples of the far north,
          whose cultures, languages, and even physical appearance
          are so different from their neighbors to the south
          that researchers generally argue they must have come to the Americas
          in a separate, much later wave of migration
          (though still many centruies ahead of Columbus).
          But all of them are Native Americans,
          which eliminates a distinction found useful by both scholars
          and indigenous peoples themselves.
        <p>In conversation, native people I have met (I think without exception)
          have used &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Native American.&rdquo;
          One day I said &ldquo;Native American&rdquo;
          when speaking to a Bolivian graduate student of indigenous descent.
          She shook her head dismissively at the phrase.
          &ldquo;Aquí somos indios,&rdquo; she explained.
          &ldquo;Los &lsquo;americanos nativos&rsquo; viven solamente en los Estados Unidos.&rdquo;
          <em>We are Indians here.
            &ldquo;Native American&rdquo; live only in the United States.</em>
          &ldquo;I abhor the term Native American,&rdquo; Means declared in 1998.
          Matching his actions to his words,
          Means had joined and become prominent in an indigenous-rights group
          called the American Indian Movement.
          &ldquo;We were enslaved as American Indians,&rdquo; he wrote,
          &ldquo;we were colonized as American Indians,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;and we will gain our freedom as American Indians,
          and then we will call ourselves any damn thing we choose.&rdquo;
        <p>Historically speaking, both &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Native American&rdquo;
          are remote from the way America's first peoples thought about themselves.
          Much as the inhabitants of the tenth-century Carolingian Empire
          did not describe themselves as &ldquo;Europeans,&rdquo;
          a name coined in the seventeenth century,
          the inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere
          did not think in terms of &ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native Americans,&rdquo;
          or any other collective hemispheric entity.
          Instead they regarded themselves as belonging to their immediate group
          &mdash; the Patuxet village in the Wampanoag confederation, for instance.
        <p>To a considerable extent, the same holds true today.
          When Russell Thornton, the UCLA anthropologist,
          kindly sent me some copies of his work,
          he enclosed his curriculum vitae,
          which identified him as a &ldquo;registered member of the Cherokee Nation,&rdquo;
          not as an Indian, Native American, Amerindian or indigenous person.
          When I mentioned this to Thornton,
          he responded that only one experience united the diverse peoples of the Americas:
          being flattened by European incursions.
          &ldquo;&lsquo;Indians&rsquo; or &lsquo;Native Americans&rsquo;
          as a category both owe their existence to Europe,&rdquo; he said.
        <p>For all these reasons,
          this book uses &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Native American&rdquo; interchangably,
          with the latter serving mainly to avoid repetition.
        <p>Note, though, that I [attempt to] use these terms
          as cultural and geographical categories,
          not racial ones.
          &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; is the Western Hemisphere's equivalent to &ldquo;European,&rdquo;
          not to &ldquo;white&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caucasion.&rdquo;
          Racial categories are inevitably problematic,
          because they are ostensibly biological
          &mdash; that is, they are supposed to be based on
          heritable physical characteristics like skin color &mdash;
          but in fact are heavily cultural,
          as demonstrated by the infamous &ldquo;one drop&rdquo; rule
          in the nineteenth-century southern United States,
          which proclaimed that men and women were Negroes,
          even when they could not be distinguished by whites from appearance,
          if any of their ancestors, no matter how remote, were African.
          Avoiding such inconsistency and ambiguity is easier
          if one eschews categorizing by race, which I have tried to do,
          except for the occasional rhetorical flourish.
        <p>In referring to particular groups of Indians
          &mdash; the Wampanoag or the Maya &mdash;
          I use a simple rule of thumb:
          I try to call groups by the name preferred by their members.
          This approach, which seems only corteous,
          is sometimes attached as condescending.
          After all, the argument runs,
          people in the United States use the English labels
          &ldquo;French&rdquo; and &ldquo;German&rdquo;
          rather than <em>français</em> and <em>Deutsch</em>.
          To insist on using &ldquo;proper&rdquo; names for Indians
          is thus to place them in a special category of fragility.
          But this objection is not well thought out.
          Although English-speakers do think
          of &ldquo;Germans&rdquo; rather than <em>Deutscher</em>,
          &ldquo;French people&rdquo; rather than <em>les français</em>,
          they tend to avoid insulting terms like
          &ldquo;Kraut&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frog.&rdquo; 
          Many common names for Indian groups are equally insulting,
          or descended from such insults.
          Unsurprisingly, they are slowly being changed.
        <p>My &ldquo;simple&rdquo; rule of thumb to call people by the name they prefer
          is more complex than it may seem.
          The far north, for example, is home to a constellation of related societies
          genrally known as &ldquo;Eskimo,&rdquo;
          but in the 1980s this term was replaced by &ldquo;Inuit&rdquo; in Canada,
          where most of these groups live,
          after complaints that &ldquo;Eskimo&rdquo;
          came from a pejorative term in in Algonquian language
          that meant &ldquo;eater of raw flesh.&rdquo;
          Why this would be bothersome seems unclear,
          because raw meat is a preferred part of northerners' diet,
          much as sushi is favored by the Japanese.
          In any case, linguists [now] believe that &ldquo;Eskimo&rdquo;
          actually stems from the Algonquian terms
          for &ldquo;snowshoe netter&rdquo;
          or &ldquo;people who speak a different language,&rdquo;
          neither of which seems especially derogatory.
          Worse for contemporary purposes,
          &ldquo;Inuit&rdquo; is also the name of a specific subgroup of Arctic societies,
          to which such northern indigeneous peoples as the Aleutiiq in the Aleutian Islands
          and Innu in Labrador do not belong.
          If that weren't enough, the Inuqpiat in Alaska,
          who belong to the Inuit subgroup
          but speak a different language than their cousins in Canda,
          have generally resisted the term &ldquo;Inuit&rdquo;
          in favor of &ldquo;Alaska Native&rdquo; or, sometimes, &ldquo;Eskimo.&rdquo;
